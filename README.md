# Scala Examples

Practical solutions for the working professional.

## Introduction

I want to help better make use of Scala in their daily work. This repository aims to provide practical, concrete examples that exercise Scala's key features and patterns without burying my audience in theory. These are borne of more than a decade of experience using the language and numerous tools typically associated.

## My Reader

Is either a newcomer, curious and continuing learner, or engineer who isn't loving the language. Scala veterans will likely be bored. A few might scoff. I'm hoping those will contribute. 

## The Problem

Since I began using Scala professionally in 2012, it's become my favorite language. I've found it an elegant and effective tool for solving a wide variety of problems. During that time, I've participated in a wide variety of projects and an even wider variety of perceptions about the language.

My views of this language and its associated tools are overwhelmingly positive. While I see tremendous benefits to its competitors (many of which have adopted Scala's feature), this remains where I want to work the most. Unfortunately, I've found many people are frustrated with the language and, if we're being honest, I'm not entirely surprised.

There's been extensive discussion from thought leaders from both industry and academia as to why Scala struggles to gain hold. I won't repeat that here (I plan to later reference this material), but I will offer my suggestion based on two recurring observations:

**First, many teams, to a degree, don't utilize Scala's key features to their potential**.

And so they fail to gain a return on their investment in this technology. It's another topic I'll steer clear of exploring here in detail, but suffice it to say upfront costs are incurred by using Scala (and similar languages). Each team will need to decide its comfort level, but there's often considerable value left on the table.

**Second, there are repeated efforts to force 

## My Solution

I don't aim to compete with similar resources that expound on academic considerations. All of those are certainly worth the reader's attention (and they'll be referenced as appropriate).

But my reader might say, "don't waste my time," so my examples will:

1. Ask, "what problem am I solving?"
1. Provide great solutions that are easily adapted.
1. "Show my work" for the interested reader.

In addition to demonstrating the language, I'll make extensive use of the tools and libraries I've found most useful in my experience. While that incurs strong opinions, I find most concepts naturally translate.

If I'm successful, my reader will find ways they can increase their productivity and gain substantial value. Some will expand their knowledge. Others may even walk away with a redemption story!
