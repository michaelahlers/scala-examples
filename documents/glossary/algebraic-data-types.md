# Glossary: Algebraic Data Types

## Summary

Algebraic Data Types (ADT) is a topic, when using Scala, **you must know.** Luckily, we can put this plain and simple:

They're a way of structuring data that reduces all possible values to a small number we can reason about. More importantly, **they're another use of the type system to make invalid states impossible to represent.**

While hardly a concept specific to Scala, the language supports them naturally, and the compiler uses them to prevent bugs chiefly through exhaustive pattern matching (_i.e._, any match statement is guaranteed to consider all possible cases).
