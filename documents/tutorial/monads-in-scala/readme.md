# Tutorial: Monads in Scala

## Rationale

If you had to choose the most essential topic to understand for effective software engineering with Scala, it would be monads. Whether you're a novice tinkering with Scala or a seasoned expert building world-class production systems, you use constructs that express this concept daily. Unsurprisingly, commentary about monads is abundant and diverse.[^1] Despite that, I've found a solid understanding of monads remains elusive for many developers. **While monad tutorials are a dime a dozen, this one might help you.**

[^1]: I've seen two common themes with monad tutorials: some attempt to explain the concept in terms of Haskell, others with a heaping pile of theory, and a mixture of the two. We'll do neither here.
